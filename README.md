### Gameplay

Click anywhere on the canvas to launch an orb at the grid. When an orb makes contact with another orb, the stationary orb assumes the color of the moving orb. If three or more orbs of the same color are adjacent to one another, they all disappear and points are added to the score. When all the orbs disappear, the grid resets and play continues.

If less than three orbs are left alone in a cluster, they can no longer be eliminated and that will trigger GAME OVER.

### Challenges


### Improvements

* Add particle explosion effect when orbs disappear

* Optimize HTML5 Canvas drawing code snippets
* Add more sophisticated game logic
* Clean up/refactor code
